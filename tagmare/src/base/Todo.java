	/* TODO LIST:
	 * - if you click a targetted card as it is being drawn from the draw pile (and maybe while it's discarded?) bad stuff
	 * happens.
	 * - if you hover over a card while they're reorganizing, they get slightly offset in the x direction.
	 * - trying to pick up and play cards ASAP when the combat starts is a little glitchy and annoying. 
	 * - Add card rarities?
	 * - Make "View Deck" button look nicer (maybe make 2 drawings in Google Drawings, one with a dropshadow for when
	 * you hover over it)?
	 * - Intent tooltips
	 * - Modifier Icon artwork
	 * - Show your health on the calendar page.
	 * - Show what the combats are on the calendar page.
	 * - Finish calendar artwork (add Week 1, Week 2, etc. text)
	 * - Add desk artwork.
	 * - Some sort of "hop" animation on PlayerModifierIcons to show when they're doing stuff? (e.g. 
	 * - ENEMIES:
	 * 		- Ideas!
	 * 		- More intents (debuff, buff, attack+buff, attack with multiple strikes) 
	 * - Curve Card?
	 * 
	 * OPTIONAL:
	 * - Make EOTLoseBlock smoothly fade out and slide down like SOTLoseBlock does for player.
